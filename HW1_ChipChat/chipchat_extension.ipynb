            "2. **Timer Counters**: A 6-bit counter is used to count clock cycles for each state. \n",
            "\n",
            "3. **State Transitions**:\n",
            "   - In the `always @(*)` block, the next state is determined based on the current state and the value of the counter.\n",
            "   - Each state has a defined number of clock cycles before transitioning to the next: \n",
            "     - RED to GREEN after 32 cycles\n",
            "     - GREEN to YELLOW after 20 cycles\n",
            "     - YELLOW to RED after 7 cycles\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Sequential Logic**: \n",
            "   - In the `always @(posedge clk or negedge reset_n)` block, the current state and outputs are updated on the rising edge of the clock.\n",
            "   - If the reset signal is active low (`reset_n`), the state and counter are reset to the initial condition (Red light ON).\n",
            "   - If enabled, the counter increments for each state until the required count is met, after which the state transitions occur.\n",

            "- Ensure your simulation and synthesis tools support `typedef` syntax as this is used to define states more clearly.\n",

            "### Explanation of Changes:\n",
            "1. **State Encoding**: The state encoding is now expanded from 2 bits to 3 bits to accommodate the new `EMERGENCY_RED` state.\n",
            "  \n",
            "2. **Emergency Logic**:\n",
            "   - Added logic for transitioning to `EMERGENCY_RED` when `emergency_btn` is pressed, either from `RED`, `GREEN`, or `YELLOW` states.\n",
            "   - In the `EMERGENCY_RED` state, the output remains red, and the FSM stays in this state as long as the emergency button remains pressed. \n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Counter Behavior**: In `EMERGENCY_RED`, the counter does not increment, ensuring that the traffic light stays in this state until the emergency button is released.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **State Transition Handling**: Reset to normal state and timer when returning to `RED` from `EMERGENCY_RED`.\n",
            "\n",
            "Make sure to verify and test the new functionality in your simulation environment to ensure that it meets the desired specifications.\n"
